# Surfs_Up

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to view the temperature trends in Hawaii as well to view the statistics regarding the entire months of June and December. This analysis would allow the surfing and ice cream businesses to determine whether they would have success year-round or if they'd be better off as seasonal openings.

## Results
What I found was that the average temperature in June was 75 degrees F and December had an average of 71 degrees F, which isn't a drastic difference when it comes to surfing or eating ice cream (in one's opinion). However, one thing to point out is that December's temperatures show a bit more of a variance when looking only at the minimum and maximum, but the standard deviation comparison is less than 1.0 difference.

## Summary
In conclusion, the temperatures variance in December is not enough evidence to deter the businesses of surfing and ice cream from having success. As said before, the averages of both months are very close and only differ in 4 degrees F which shows that these businesses have the opportunity of doing well year-round due to the weather conditions.

Some other queries I could've done to at least see where the stations are most active in providing weather information and those could be better areas to promote the expansion of shops. Another important key factor to maintaining business would've been if we had the weather description as well; this would help us see whether there's more rain during a certain month or higher winds or sun. Temperature would only be a determinant if people want to get out of the house, but for surfing there needs to be more determinants considering that people who surf require the right conditions in order to go into the water.
